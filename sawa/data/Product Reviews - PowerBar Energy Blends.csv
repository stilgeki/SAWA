LexingtonLynn,6/12/2013,40,f,Lexington,KY,5,Race to Review Energy Blends,Energy Blends are Amazing,The Power Bar Energy Blends are the perfect fuel for the middle of a long run.  Plus they are small enough to carry in a belt pouch without adding extra weight or bulk.  No mess either!  This is a great product for us athletes.,,,
Squeaky45,6/12/2013,36,f,Westminster,MD,4,Race to Review Energy Blends,"small package, big fuel","let me preface this with why I am scoring this as a 4. The only reason this product is not a 5 is due to the taste of the blueberry/banana. That pouch was a little tart for my taste but I am also not a fan of tart things. The Mango was amazing!Currently training for a triathalon I have been working through various different fueling options, most of the bars and chew that I have tried either sat too heavy in my stomach or were impossible to stomach due to taste. When I first got the product I was excited since this would be the first product that was a pouch. First tried it before a 2 hour bike, after 2 hours of riding I still felt strong and could have continued. Second pouch was taken before a 5 mile run, this was the true test since I usually have problems keeping anything down except liquid. I felt great through the entire run and have been incorporating the pouches into my fueling regimen.Overall a great product. If you prefer sweet things get the mango...if you like tart get the blueberry!",,,21

I was skeptical because so far everything has given me an stomach ache, but it didn't. I love the energy the Powerbar Performance Energy Blends give me without the added calories. Also, I don't usually like anything with blueberries, but I loved both flavors they make. I love them so much I am on my second case! This is a great product!",,193,2
zeebee74,6/12/2013,39,f,Hanford,CA,2,Race to Review Energy Blends,PowerBar energy blends...............,I really appreciate the energy on the go! But the PowerBar  energy blend kind of tasted like baby food! But the ok tasting baby food!! LOL,,,
SuziMM,6/12/2013,36,f,Farmington Hills,MI,4,Race to Review Energy Blends,Delicious Energy for Exercise... With One Flaw,"I'm a distance runner - I run half marathons for fun, and my long runs are typically in the double digits.  A girl like me needs carbohydrates to fuel those long runs, which often go more than two hours.  So I was super excited to try the PowerBar Performance Energy Blends to see how they worked compared to my usual fuel (Gu, Gu Chomps or Honey Stingers).  First, the taste: the PowerBar Blends come in great flavors!  The blueberry banana was my favorite, but the apple mango strawberry was pretty good too.  Score one for PowerBar - way tastier than my typical Gu, and it has a much more palatable texture than Gu too.  It's easier to ingest than solids like Gu Chomps and Honey Stingers.It's a great deal on calories compared to other fuel - only 80 calories compared to 100 or more for other fuels.  PowerBar Performance Energy Blends WORK great too - 21 grams of carbs gave me plenty of energy to refuel mid run and keep my performance strong.So... PowerBar Blends are pretty awesome with only one drawback... but it's a big one.  It's the packaging.  It's supposed to be better and more convenient because it's resealable.  But a runner doesn't need a resealable package - we're going to down the whole thing at once to get those carbs flowing.  And that re-closeable cap is HUGE.  It is way too big and cumbersome to carry in a fuel belt on a long outdoor run.  So, it's great for fueling before a long run or good for indoor exercise use, but it's pretty bulky to carry when space is at a premium.Fix the packaging and this product is a total winner!!",,277,3
staceysuther,6/12/2013,28,f,San Tan Valley,AZ,4,Race to Review Energy Blends,Great Energy source! Easy to use,I really enjoyed the new PowerBar Performance Energy Blends. They are perfect for long distance running when you need that extra energy boost. I like having something available when I start to hit the wall.

Mamac39,6/12/2013,41,f,Lake In The Hills,IL,5,Race to Review Energy Blends,Time to fuel up,"I have tried PowerBar bars, but this Performance Energy Blends is nothing like I have ever seen on the market before.  I like the idea of a fruit-based energy food formulated with the PowerBar energy enhancing formula.  And for 80 calories, that is not bad.  I try to follow a no sugar/no grain diet (Paleo), and this product seems to work for me.  It feels like real food sports nutrition.  I like the taste, it is mild and smooth, essentially a fruit puree (almost like applesauce) and goes down easily without the need for water.I am currently training for a 9k and trying to build up endurance so this product works really well for my training.  I also do long hikes with my family and a weekly Sh’Bam class with my neighbor and the Performance Energy Blends works well for these activities as well.  It delivers energy quickly, easy to consume on the go (without the mess) and tastes great.  It works well as a pre-workout boost or during a long activity.  I especially like the Apple Mango Strawberry flavor and it is a delicious way to power through my activities.I like the convenience of the packaging and the easy resealable top.  The only thing I don’t like about the packaging is there are many fruit blend/applesauce geared for kids in very similar packaging on the market.  I read on the label not to give the Performance Energy Blends to kids and I put them out of reach so my 6 year old son does not use them.  The packaging looks so wholesome, but if you read the ingredients, this is definitely an adult performance recovery food, not for kids.  Overall, I really like the product and hope they come out in additional flavors. Yum!",,,

I enjoyed the two free samples and like the flavor very much. My kids even had a sip and liked them too. Much better than those juice boxes packed with sugar. Am definitely going to be purchasing these again and again. ",,,

I have never been able to exercise after eating, as I always seem to cramp. I decided to try the Energy Blend one morning before exercising. I thought it tasted great. But the big test was my run. I was very surprised that I didnt cramp at all, plus I felt like I had more energy to finish than I normally do. I am very pleasantly surprised and plan to eat it again before exercise. Just not sure how often since I dont want to pay the $2.99 !",,,

I like the packaging - it even fits nicely into my yoga mat's bag! And I like that I can drink some and then reseal it. That way I can save some for after yoga class, if needed. I liked both flavors that I tried but my favorite was the Banana Blueberry.I love yoga and go at least 4 days a week. I feel like it makes me a better athlete. You shouldn't have a full stomach for yoga class but you definitely need energy. So about one hour before yoga class I had a PowerBar Performance Energy Blend.I found that it worked perfectly. I was energized enough after a long day at work to go to yoga and I wasn't hungry or full during class.",,,

rkgilpin,6/12/2013,39,f,Jeannette,PA,2,Race to Review Energy Blends,PowerBar Energy Blends- not for me,I have been running and biking a lot lately so I was really excited to have the opportunity to try the PowerBar Energy Blends. The first thing I noticed was how small the package was (which is a good thing) and also how extremely easy to open it was. Now it was time for me to taste them. Since these are made from real fruit I was expecting to love them! That was definitely not the case. The texture was like baby food and that is all I could think about when I was drinking the banana blueberry one. I really had to force it down. I will say that the apple strawberry one was not as bad but I still did not like it. I didn't enjoy the texture or taste at all. I am sure that these are great for some people but unfortunately they just don't work for me. This is so disappointing because I really do like the idea of them and the ease of drinking them. ,,,
xtapunt,6/12/2013,35,f,New York,NY,5,Race to Review Energy Blends,Easy to use and good results,"I work out in the morning – otherwise I stress out about it the rest of the day, lose motivation, and get tired or busy doing other things. In the morning I’m in desperate need of coffee but I don’t have much of a desire for anything else: I’m not too hungry. But having some of a PowerBar Performance Energy Blend, and then taking the rest of the pouch with me on my run, helped me feel good during my entire workout. And I like that it’s lower in calories than PowerBar bars – at only 80 calories, I think it’s a calorie bargain.Before I leave for a long run, I take my dog out for a long walk. He’s a little dog so he’s not able to run with me, although I wish I could! So to save precious morning time, I took a pouch with me while walking him. It was easy to store in a bag I attach to his leash, and easy to drink with one hand while the other hand holds the leash.The fact that I can easily fit this product into my current workout schedule and lifestyle, and that I like the taste, nutrition, and energy levels it provides me, means that I am a fan of PowerBar Performance Energy Blends.",,,70

What I can say about PowerBar is that they taste amazing, feel much more healthy than some of the other ""energy"" sources, and actually deliver a boost of energy that helps. In comparing how I felt running after I drank the PowerBar vs not- there is certainly a difference. I felt as though my stamina was up and I certainly seemed to have more energy to finish the goal I have set for myself.My fiancé now drinks these with me before we start our running and although they can be a little pricey- I believe we will continue to use them to help us achieve the results we've been looking and working so hard for.",,,

You need to hydrate, eat healthy, and avoid anything that’s too heavy (before, during, and after your ride) because you need to maintain your blood sugar levels at all times. So I bring a number of different easily portable, storable, and eatable foods along with my on my rides: bars, gels, nuts, dried fruits, etc. After joining this Bzz Campaign, I also brought a PowerBar Performance Energy Blend along with me.I felt like it gave me good, stable energy and sustained me for an acceptable amount of time. I love that it can fit in my small bike pouch and that I don’t have to worry about it spilling or leaking (like my gels sometimes do). And I find it much easier to eat than a bar or nuts and fruit. As for the taste, I was really happy with that too. I like the blended consistency and the fact that it’s recognizable as fruit.

maile44,6/11/2013,42,f,Reno,NV,5,Race to Review Energy Blends,Guilt-Free Energy to Help Extend My Run Time,"I recently started working out after a hiatus when we had to move for my job.  It's now 2 months after we've moved and it's pretty difficult to get on track again, and I noticed that I needed something to help me with my endurance while running.  I was extremely happy to receive the news that as a BzzAgent, I would get to try the PowerBar Performance Energy Blends for free!  To be blunt, I was expecting the worst.  In my head I imagined that these would be thick, gel-like substances that would taste extremely fake and synthetic.  But, I was excited to try anything that might help me last longer when running.  So on the first day, I woke up, got ready to run, and tried the apple mango strawberry flavor.  YUM!  To my surprise, it had the consistency and taste of applesauce - NICE!  I really liked it, which was a good thing, as then if it worked, I'd be sure to get it again.  I then got my music together, put my shoes on, and off I ran.  I usually do a mile or so and then burn out and start taking walking breaks.  That day, I could do the entire 5k course without stopping!  I was so happy!Two days later I decided to extend my route a little bit and try the blueberry banana flavor.  I liked the flavor, and again, wasn't synthetic tasting.  This day I ran 4 miles - yes!  I used to run 10k when I was in shape, so it's my goal to creep back up to that level.  It looks like I've found the right energy aid to help me reach my goal!  I'm so glad that there were so many coupons that came with the samples, as I can still use some for myself, while giving them away to my runner friends.Overall, I thought that both flavors tasted great, but my favorite would definitely be the apple one.  I eat healthy, currently only saving carbs for my cheat day on the weekend, and also eating minimal meat on weekdays.  This is a great energy boost that I don't feel guilty about eating.  Also, it is just the right amount that you don't feel too full, and I don't feel like I have to wait x amount of time before running.  I have been recommending this like crazy to my runner friends and those at work, and so far everyone else who has tried them loves them as well.  Great campaign to help me and my friends with our fitness goals!",,,4
Vchinery,6/10/2013,47,f,Stewartstown,PA,4,Race to Review Energy Blends,Smooth yet satisfying..,I workout almost everyday. Some days I just don't have the energy and would rather sleep than workout but that is not an option. That's why I was so excited when Bzzagent contacted me about trying Power Bar Energy Blends. The great flavor combined with convenience makes this a definite plus for my workout. I throw one in my gym bag in the morning and eat it 30 minutes before a workout. it gives me the energy i need without the crash that can come from sugar laden drinks and bars. I prefer to refrigerate my blends but they can be eaten at room temperature. They are smooth and full of flavor. I prefer the strawberry mango for eating straight out of the package. I'm not as big a fan of the banana blueberry so I tried it in a smoothie. The texture is like baby food so it's blends great. This is definitely a welcome addition to my workout routine. I'm hoping they come out with more new flavors. Thank you Power Bar. ,,429,0

I do use the energy bars from the Power Bar brand and I do like those....so, I wanted to try the energy blends. I do not find them to be any better than if you eat one of the bars before hand.....I prefer the bars because it gives a more substantial feeling of having something in you prior to a run......where I tried my second sample is after running for an hour and going into the second hour......it's more beneficial to have the blends for this time because of the convienence of it being a quicker option to get fuel in you during a run....I will be purchasing more for this point in my runs......the flavor is a little tart, which is fine for me.....may not be for others......I did show the pack and explain to the people I run with and they said that they would be open to getting some and trying to see what works best for them......some of the runners are not open minded and stick with what they know already works for them.

squidfiste,6/10/2013,35,f,Astoria,NY,3,Race to Review Energy Blends,Performance baby food,"If you have kids, the packaging of PowerBar Energy Blends probably looks familiar. The contents will probably be familiar too. It's pureed fruit.  Essentially, it's baby food. And it's pretty tasty!The website product page explains that the formula is two parts glucose to one part fructose. That's sugar - essentially, glucose is carb sugar and fructose is fruit sugar. If you look at the ingredients, you'll see that it's made from ""Dual Source Energy Blend"" - reconstituted fruit puree which provides the fructose - and Dextrose, a form of glucose found in honey, corn, and other sources. The website claims that this product will ""deliver 20-50% more energy to muscles than glucose alone,"" which I'm sure they have based on quantifying the impact of the two sugars. As to the claim that the product will ""improve endurance performance by 8%,"" I'm sure that there is some validity. I don't think it's unreasonable considering that consuming sugar will provide more energy than not consuming sugar.I used one package to fuel before exercise and the other on a separate occasion to refuel midway. I didn't notice a particular difference either way but I'm not a consummate athlete with a finely tuned sense of energy output. I like that the taste of the product isn't affected by the use of chemical additives or preservatives. It really does taste good, like baby food. I like that the product can be resealed, although there's not so much product that you would necessarily need to save some for later. The packaging isn't compact enough that you could take this with you without some sort of tote. Also, I forget whether it is recyclable but I think I remember it not being so. Upside: my cat loves to play with this type of cap. I didn't see this product in any store, although I did an online search. The price per package ranges from $2.50 to $2.99. I find this cost to be prohibitive, especially considering that a person could essentially replicate this at home by pureeing fruit and honey and pouring it in a plastic baggie. Overall, it tastes good, it's not full of chemicals, and it does have some scientific merit. However, it's $3 a pop for what is essentially baby food with added sugar. You can get the same package of baby food for half the price. To note, PowerBar is owned by Nestle who also owns Gerber.

After trying the product, I can say that it is a good fuel option for a short workout (under an hour), though as for using it on a long run for me it would not be ideal as it would not last long enough.  I would have to carry multiple packets with me to use on a long run which frankly I would not have room for in my pockets/belt.  The other thing that I wasn't too thrilled with was the consistency of the product.  It is thinner/more liquid-y than a gel would be and while the flavors were good, I was a bit nauseated by the consistency.

After a long night, waking up early and staying motivated and energized to work out can be difficult.  PowerBar Performance Energy Blends gave me just the right amount of energy (without giving me the jitters) to power me thru my workout and keep me energized in time for work at 8.  As suggested, I took one Performance Blend prior to working out and one directly following my workout.  I tried both the berry and apple flavors and preferred the apple.  I also tried the second blend refrigerated.  I am someone who has a hard time with the consistency of certain foods so I actually preferred the Performance Blend refrigerated.  It reminded me of yogurt.  I noticed a difference in my performance (and mood) about 10 minutes after consuming an entire Performance Blend.  There are 19 grams of sugar which is a lot for the small package (considering a 12oz coke has 39 grams) but I never noticed a post workout crash.  I also like how convient the packaging is for the Performance Blend.  I was able to just through it in my gym bag, no mixing required and no risk of spillage.  I also like that the top is resealable so you don't have to worry about finishing it all within the first few minutes of opening it.  I had a little 10 minutes before the workout began and finished it immediately before beginning.  Overall I would recommend this energy gel to any athlete looking for a jolt of energy without loading down your body with a bar or filling your stomach with liquid from an energy drink.  It works almost immediately and the effects will last long enough to get through rigorous activity for just over an hour!  ",,,

I am not going to get into why that is, their blend of fructose to glucose,etc , because I believe that it is all very individualized as to what works for you and your biochemistry.

In other words,  Power Bar placed blended fruit in a bag and called it an energy blend.  I could achieve the same result by placing an applesauce and spoon in my gym bag.  Nonetheless, Power Bar Performance Energy Blends are a bit easier to carry about, making me rate this product a 4 star.  I do appreciate the fact that they did not add preservatives.  I did not really care for the banana blueberry blend.  It reminded me too much of baby food.  The apple mango blend was tart, but more doable than the banana blueberry.

What I really liked is that they absorbed quickly and didn't make me feel nauseous like so many things I've tried. The banana blueberry was my favorite flavor, though I liked both flavors. After an hour of riding, they gave me the energy I needed to do ride the last hour. I didn't get that heavy feeling in my gut when I finished them.I appreciate the sample I received from Bzzagent since I may not have tried them otherwise. I have looked for them in the store. The only drawback for me was the price. The Performance Energy Blends are almost twice as much as an energy bar.

I have recently started working out aggressively again.  Due to recently having 3 kids, I had packed on pounds and gotten out of shape in the past two years.  So, I have now lost over 50 pounds of baby weight and am making my workouts much harder versus the standard ""walks"". Now, this increase in my workouts have also proved to be very difficult for me so I was really glad to be on this campaign.  With my runs using the Energy Blends, I was running 3.5 miles.  I have only ran this about 3 times before and it has been REALLY hard for me to do.  I had taken the Energy Blend about 15 minutes before my run and I was very suprised that I did not feel like I ""hit a wall"" in my workout.  While it didn't suddenly make the workout a breeze, it did help keep me at a steady level the entire workout. I didn't feel any sort of surge in energy at all (similar to a crazy sugar spike) which I was very happy out.   I love portable, easy access foods as I use them a lot with my three toddlers and their fruits/baby food. The twist off top is easy to use, you suck it right down and toss everything.  SO convenient!Overall I thought the taste was good.  It wasn't too sweet or overpowering. I loved the texture as it was easy to swallow.  I ate mine before my workout but I could easily see the value of using this during a longer workout. It is blended so well that it could easily be eaten during a long workout without needing to chew it or having it be hard to swallow.  Also, it was a good amount, not too much to make you full but enough to fill your stomach so that you could continue.  I found this to just be ideal.  I haven't gone to buy any additional ones but have given out coupons to other coworkers that workout.  Depending on the cost, it might sway my opinion.  If they are under $2.00, it woud make it a good fit for daily workouts.  If they are more expensive, it might limit my buying of them because of the overall cost for a daily workout additive.  ",,,

Before riding the elliptical one evening I tried my new PowerBar Energy Blends in the Apple Mango Strawberry flavor. The first thing I noticed about this particular flavor was how thick and sugary it tasted. It was almost like it was a sweet treat rather than a workout drink. I was glad I drank this BEFORE my workout because if I would have tried to drink it AFTER the workout when I am always super thirsty, I think the sweetness would have gagged me a little bit. It's definitely a quick form of sustenance but I did not notice any extra 'oomph' in my workout after having drank this nor did I feel any different afterwards.The Banana Blueberry flavor was my favorite! It was a little healthier tasting with just a little sweetness to make it yummy but not so sweet that it overpowered the taste buds. I drank this first thing when I got up in the morning, before I went for a jog. It was a very quick a convenient source of energy! Made me feel bright and bubbly and I was able to jog my route - no problem - with no hunger pains for a while. You feel 'clean' after drinking this flavor too.

This is not the case with the new PowerBar Performance Energy Blends.  I found the flavors to be good and the texture and consistance is similar to applesauce.  If you have ever tried the the new squeezable applesauces out on the market, you might find these to have similar taste and texture.  However, with the PowerBar Performance Energy Blends, you will feel more energized after taking them.  I tried both flavors, but I prefer the taste of the apple/mango/strawberry.  This flavor is more similar to applesauce which is why I like to better.  The other flavor, banana/blueberry is also good, if you like the flavor of ripe bananas.I would like to point out that I did have difficulty finding this product in stores.  I tried looking at Target, Walmart, Ralphs, Albersons's and Vons.

I mean, this didn't seem like any sort of meal replacement type thing, but rather more of a quick boost, prior to or during a workout. The calorie count (about 80 per pack) was rather low to really offer a full energy boost in my opinion. I did find the ingredient list to be adequate, and like that it didn't have junk or was overly processed--it was just mostly fruit puree.The flavor combinations were good and instantly appealed to me. Both of them had a very fresh taste, which was true to the fruit shown on the packet. I didn't notice any artificial aftertaste, but just a bright, fresh fruit flavor. My one gripe, and the ruiner of the product for me, was the texture. It was truly a thick puree style, and made me feel like I was eating baby food. It was thicker than a smoothie, so it wasn't a drink, but you certainly wouldn't chew it. It was quite disconcerting to me, and I'd really rather it was a drink. I guess if you're on the go, it's an easy packet to slurp down, but I'd rather eat a piece of fruit or have a smoothie.

Top is easy to twist off and you can actually suck the entire contents out of the container. The Power Blends have a very unusual texture. It falls somewhere between water and a gel. The texture is like a ""gritty"" jello. Gritty secondary to the puree fruit within the product. But here's the biggest draw back for me. When I'm exercising I want my energy supply to be high in calories and carbs to help replenish or supplement what I'm burning. The Power Blend has 80 calories and only 21 grams of carbs.

I have really used both Gels and GU packs as a part of my running routine for the past 5 years so I was pretty excited when I got this BzzKit with the PowerBar blends.  About one hour before my cycling class I used the Banana Blueberry pack.  The best way to describe the texture to those of you that have never had anything like this is that it is similar to applesauce or even baby food!  The flavor is great but not super sweet or overwhelming.  The day I used it, I was taking a particularly hard spinning class....usually about 30 minutes in, I can feel the fatigue kicking it.  This class, I noticed that while my legs were still burning, I was able to keep a pretty consistent pace.  However, I think the greatest benefit to this product was that it was able to sustain me not only through my workout but the extra hour after for me to get home and make dinner.  Usually within 15 minutes of leaving class I would be ravenous and end up eating a bunch of crap while I was making dinner, pretty much making my workout all for nothing.

As a BzzAgent, I was asked to review this product and how it compared to what I am presently using to get increased energy and improved performance. I must say it is easy enough to consume with a screw off cap and tube shape packaging. The various fruit flavorings are nothing special, but should be agreeable to most product users. The consistency is similar to a puree, but not nearly as messy. While I did find the energy blends acceptable, I didn't find it to provide me with any additional benefits over what I normally use. Even though I could definitely feel the boost in energy, it did not measure up to the extra endurance I was expecting to find. I'm not saying that I would be opposed to using this product again in the future, but I was actually looking forward to finding something that is even better and not just comparable to the products I already use during my workouts.",,,

The texture was grainy in the blueberry banana, but nice and smooth in the apple mango strawberry.  The flavor of the blueberry banana was terrible, like overripe mushy bananas.  I only sensed a blueberry aftertaste.  The apple mango strawberry had pretty good flavor, but not enough for me to ever try it again.  The nice thing about these pouches is that they're real fruit and easily portable, when you don't want to take a ""dry"" snack with you to the gym, on a run, where ever.  Also, cleanup is simple- just throw away the pouch!  I can't say I felt any different after (partially) consuming my PowerBar Performance Energy Blends.

I always seem to hit the wall at this one particular point (the bar I pass by is merely coincidence...probably), but I sailed right through it and had a little more to spare after fueling up with Energy Blends. The flavor is fresh, and natural. It's a small enough amount that you have room for a margarit...I mean that it doesn't upset your stomach during a run. It's portable, so I'm sure it'd be pretty easy to tote along for those half/full marathon runners and trainers. (I am not one of those amazing athletes, so I'm speculating.)  The one thing I wasn't completely excited by was the texture. The flavor was good enough that it didn't matter that much, but I'd honestly prefer a smoothie (or a margar...wait. what?) Far too many pre-workout formulas are either too strong, or upset the tummy, or have side effects (zombies started somewhere.

I loved the taste of it and the convenience of the packets.  They were very easy to open and easy to eat - and the flavor tasted like pure bananas and blueberries.My workout went great, and I don't know if it was the Energy Blend or just the fact that it was a beautiful day (or both!) - but I had a great workout.  I was able to do my 5 miles in a great time, and didn't feel wiped out when I was finished.  These snacks are definitely going to be part of my pre (and possible post) workout!My husband took my other sample to work and he ate it for his mid-morning snack.  He also felt that it tasted great, and got him through that time when it's too early for lunch, but you need to have something to keep you going.  He liked the ease of the container and his only complaint was that he would have liked a larger size - he was till a bit hungry when he had finished his energy blend.I love the fact that these energy blends have real fruit, are east to just throw in your purse or lunchbox and have C2Max for that extra boost!

So I got their opinions and both have had various supplemental products. Both agreed the taste was good, easy to use and transport in their gear bags without them galling apart or melting like some of the bars do. My son said he felt more energetic longer and felt his level and duration of exhaustion was less than normal.  My daughter who is picky, liked the taste as well and noticed a small amount of energy difference.

If I had to pick my favorite thing about the POWER BAR packs I would say I love how their small/light weight enough to slip into your pocket and take off running.

However, I did burp the flavor of the blend a few times during the run, which was a little gross and scary. The last thing I want, is to get sick while running. Again, it may just be because I'm not used to these types of energy enhancers. I usually go for chews/gummies.

(3 on 1 off) I've often purchased the pureed fruit blends (and often make my own both fruit & veggie) as a natural fuel source. I think they're ideal for quick nutrient absorption and convenient. The prepackaged pureed fruit is excellent to take along when I'm on the go. I tried the Apple Mango Strawberry blend as well as the Blueberry Banana. I REALLY liked the Apple Mango Strawberry. However, the Blueberry Banana tasted a bit too much like baby food. Both products were great as a fuel source, however I'm not sure they worked any better than any other pureed fruit. As far as I could tell the ""Dual Energy Source"" was merely just a fruit combination. Which is cool, I'm all about the natural stuff...but the label led me to believe there was more to it than just fruit. The PowerBar Performance Energy Blends are considerably more expensive than their counterparts, and are relatively the same product. The main noticeable difference between the PowerBar Blends and the fruit puree's I normally buy was the after-taste. Some fruit puree's take on the taste of the packaging. This was pleasantly NOT the case with PowerBar.I would have given the product 4 stars if the price was more competitive with comparable products.

When I got my bzzkit I couln't wait to try the fruit blends.  I'm really not a fan of banana at all, so I knew that flavor wouln't go down easy.  And it didn't.  As much as I love blueberries, all I tasted was banana and I couln't finish the pouch.  I gave it to my 6 year old daughter, who couln't finish it either.  The consistency was like pureed fruit, but the texture turned me off to.. I felt it was a tiny bit gritty, probably from the blueberries.  I'd rather puree my own blueberries and add another fruit for extra flavor.  So needless to say, the blueberry banana flavor was a flop.  A few days later I decided to try the apple strawberry flavor.  It was OK.  Nothing too exciting, but I guess that's what you get when you want a super healthy energy source.  The consistency was similar to pureed fruit (again) and the texture was nice and smooth.  I shared this pouch with my other daughter (7) and she liked it too.  I can't say I felt more energized, but I did feel good about eating this snack.  My only other hangup about this product is that it reminded me of the new pouch style of babyfood.  In fact, one of my kids asked why I bought baby food when she saw the Pwoerbar Performance Energy Blends pouch!  I didn't run faster, or feel energized.  It just satisfied my hunger.

PowerGels have 110-120 calories and 27-28g of carbs in a smaller package.3.  Cost is approximately $1 more than the PowerGel.4.  Texture of product was odd.  It's not a liquid or a gel.

So giving PowerBar Energy Blends was definitely something new for me. I started out with the blueberry and banana blend before my usual 3 mile run. The blend itself was delicious. I love blueberries in pretty much everything so I had no problems enjoying this one. During and after my run I felt about the same as I usually do on any other normal day. The next day I drank the strawberry and apple blend. I was not a huge fan of the flavors together but my palate is picky when it comes to sweet flavors. Once again during and after I felt about the same. Perhaps a bit more hydrated than usual but other than that I didn't feel much of an energized difference. The flavors were great, but as an energy source for workouts I wouldn't say it was the best, but could be better if it became part of a consistent routine. ",,,

ClaireShack,5/20/2013,44,f,Kingsport,TN,4,Race to Review Energy Blends,PowerBar® Offers a Great Option On The Go...,"In my Buzz Kit I received one of each flavor offered. I had a Banana Blueberry PowerBar® Performance Energy Blend pouch and an Apple Mango Strawberry PowerBar® Performance Energy Blend pouch. I also received coupons for $1.50 off two. Here are my observations:1. PowerBar® Performance Energy Blends are gluten free. Hooray to PowerBar® for putting out a healthy and viable option for those with Celiac disease and/or gluten intolerance. 2. They are a good source of Vitamin C and they are formulated to deliver vital needs to muscles when endurance is needed the most. This means they are good for anyone in sports and high energy lifestyles (because sometimes chasing a toddler around is also a high energy sport). 3. They taste good, but not great. This is the only reason I gave them a four star rating. I found the taste to be a little flat and a little bland. This is NOT a major deal though. These pouches are not meant to be a gourmet snack. The consistency was nice and not hard to swallow (and for me that says a lot because I have foods with weird consistencies). 4. Great packaging! I love the pouch! It's easy to slip into a purse, a bag or just about anywhere. It's easy to eat and be done with it. Great idea. I love the pouches for baby food... but never thought of them being used for grown-up food too. Nice delivery! I would say PowerBar® was on the cutting edge with these. I have not seen any other products offering this packaging. All in all I would highly recommend these. They are great to have on hand, and I plan on using some of my coupons to stock up so we have them in the summer (for those hikes and other outings). I would even say it would be great to keep some of these around in your emergency kit or your home emergency kit. They keep, are easy to store and are nutritious. Good product! ",,51,

For distance races I usually put an energy gel or two in a pouch or pocket somewhere  to replenish my energy stores on the fly, and before a shorter run I usually fuel up with a pouch of Energy Blast gel chews.  I was very excited to try the new Energy blend products.  Why they do taste delicious  I didn't feel that noticeable pick me up in quite the same way as the other products I use (although it could be that this one does not have caffeine as some of the others use).  Since the new Energy Blends are a bigger pouch I would only be able to use them as a pre-run energizer since the size makes them harder to pack along.  The biggest hurdle keeping me from becoming a regular user of this product is the price.  I typically buy my Energy Blasts and Energy Gels at my local Kroger store.  They often have them on sale for $1 each, and when they do I stock up.  On my latest visit to see if they stock the Energy Blends I was disappointed to see them on sale for $2.00 each.

twit2007,5/17/2013,47,f,North Palm Beach,FL,3,Race to Review Energy Blends,Did Not Enhance My Training  but Found Another Use,"This is a tough review because I had such high hopes. Let's start with the positives. PowerBar Energy Blends have natural ingredients that are made up mostly of power fruits, almost tastes like a puree, I was happy with the healthfulness of the ingredients. The two flavors I tried were blueberry/banana and apple/mango/strawberry, I liked the taste of the apple/mango/strawberry the best which surprised me. The packaging was convenient with its twist off cap but a little large to carry in a fanny pack while running.The reason I gave the product a score of 3 was because it is called a energy blend and I do not feel it did that. I took them as directed on packaging approximately 30 to 60 minutes prior to running on two separate occasions. In both instances, I did not notice even a subtle difference, I was really hopeful it would make a difference but it did not. I have used similar products before so I do know what to expect. I would actually buy these because I figured out another use for them. For the times when I am traveling or away from home and cannot get my daily fruit requirement, these are a easy and convenient way to get those nutrients and keep up a healthy diet.Thanks to PowerBar and BzzAgent for letting me try this product.",,,5

That was definitely the less tasty of the two.  The apple mango strawberry flavor was better in both of our opinions, but he liked it less than I did.

I also like the fact that you can close them back up if you don't finish or want the whole thing.

I got my BzzKit in the mail the day before I was heading out for a military training trip, so I threw them in my check on luggage, knowing they would be perfect for my runs while I was away.    We all know how hard it is to work out and eat healthy when you are away from home, but I forced myself to get up and run this morning, but first I popped open the Blueberry/Banana Powerbar Performance Energy Blend.  I was very surprised with the taste, it was so good, which is very unusual for energy bars/gels, it actually resembled a smoothie in my opinion, and this worried me, simply because I did not want anything heavy on my stomach.  Even though it tasted light, I was afraid I would get stomach cramps.  I decided to do a 3 mile run around base and try to beat my time of 31 minutes.  Just as a motivator to stay working out while I am here.  I felt good during the run, didn’t feel as tired as I normally do when I try to run first thing in the morning, and was able to complete my run in 32 minutes, not my best, but it was definitely lower than my average, especially for runs first thing in the morning.  And I didn’t have any stomach cramps, actually my stomach felt lighter during my run than it does when I eat an energy bar!Overall I was pleased with Powerbar Performance Energy Blends, they tasted great, gave me a much needed boost in my run, come in a convenient pack and are made by a brand that has proven to be a leader in energy/performance products.  One con about this product would have to be the price, I could not see myself paying the price for this on a regular basis, but would keep it in mind when I have a race or PT test.  Another con is that the product really should have some proteins in it, maybe less sugar for those of us who try to avoid products with a high sugary content, once again, this is a reason that I would not use the product regularly but only on occasions.",,,

I like to challenge myself on runs or working out and I have those ""HECK NO"" moments when my body and mind have had enough. So, finding the right juice to get me through those tough times is essential.Before my last couple runs I tried out the new Power Bar Performance Energy Blends. When I found myself reaching that point I noticed that it didn't take much more than an, ""Okay, you can do this!,"" and I was able to power through with ease. Normally, I would have to slow down or stop to refocus and pump myself up.

So anyways yes it's small, and so easy to open (I literally opened it with one hand....I was uh simulating a run to se if I could open it then and yep it can be done). I ate it right before I started taking a jog with the husband. The taste was so yummy, now I must say I am amazed how can powerbar make something so good have so much protein ( I admit I invisioned some kind of meat paste with yucky fish oil) but wowzers was I way off. This stuff is good. It tasted like a fruit smoothie almost, must say I LOVED the banana blueberry. It slid down your throat (which is good when your running, we all know we don't like a choking runner). If you can't tell it really was surprisingly good. I could see myself earring these just to eat them as a snack - and yes they are that food. So the jog begins, me and hubby neck and neck as usual but then half way through he starts to slow down. He's walking, and oh yea I am still jogging. We made it to the end and incase you did not know.....victory is mine!

The only critique I would make would be making a smaller cap size so that the pouches would more easily fit in a running belt.My kids tasted the Energy Blends after a recent race, too, and loved both of the flavors.

I love the feature of the cap which makes it easy to recap your fruit and save it for later. The first flavor I tried was apple mango strawberry. The fruit had the texture of applesauce and tasted delicious. The second flavor blueberry banana is gross it tastes like baby food with not much flavor. Both fruit pouches were convenient to carry and are great because you do not need to worry about keeping them cool.

As gym goers who are often on a tight schedule often a Powerbar product is just what we needed to keep us on the move, so I was very excited to be part of this campaign.  I received the Energy Blend packets and liked the compact look of the packaging.  They were easy to use and easy to store.  The flavors were excellent, though texture was very much like baby food.  The biggest issue that I had with the product is the Nutritional value, they have no protein.  When looking for this type of product, something to use before or after a workout, I would want something with protein in it.  Overall, I think the idea and the concept are a good one, but some focus needs to be paid to providing more nutritional value.  ",,,

Before my run today, I tried one of the Power Bar Performance Energy Blends - used the ""pre"" workout one that is banana/blueberry.First of all, the texture surprised me. Its like mashed fruit. I'm used to all sorts of energy products and expected it to be runnier but it was somewhat thick. It was almost chewable. It also tasted just like it was advertised - it tastes just like fresh bananas and blueberries, but a bit more like the bananas. Considering its straight fruit, it was really good and healthy. Secondly, I used it as directed - 30 to 60 minutes before exercise. I ""drank"" it about 40 minutes before an 8 mile run. Its all I had and this is after a night before where I had plenty to hydrate myself, but skipped dinner. Not the smartest idea, but I wasn't too tired on the run so the nutritional value and advertising about the fueling did work.Finally, it was easy to use and dispose of. Had I taken it on my run and used during, it is in a container that won't lead all over if you pack it out from a trail run.I liked this product and will continue to use it. Compared to the other products I usually use before, during and after distance runs, it is one that tastes good and has a decent consistency. RECOMMEND!",,,145

For short periods of biking it gives a nice boost, for continuous biking if the consumption is more then 3 PowerBars, the thirst is increasing tremendously. Also I am not a big fan of sweet stuff and PowerBar for me is definitely sweet. Probably this makes me thirstier then usual. My son is loving the sweetness of PowerBar! There is a downfall of the packaging, I am not loving the ""nozzle"" at all.  It could be smoother or more rounded.

I was really surprised by the texture, which was reminiscent of baby food applesauce instead of a liquid like energy drinks.  The taste was also much better.  It was fruity and good instead of that awful too much sugar Kool-Aid taste that I associate with energy drinks.I set out on my run, which is actually a walk-run combo, and the weather was absolutely perfect; sunny with just a little bit of chill in the air.  My energy level remained high and I was really enjoying the activity.  About halfway through the 4 mile route, I had the other pouch:  Banana Blueberry.  I think that I liked that one even better, being a huge fan of both bananas and  blueberries.  Throughout the second half, my energy level stayed high and the entire activity was enjoyable.After the run, I was feeling strong and well and was able to jump right into the many chores that I had planned for that day. I never experienced a crash, nor did I have the cravings that generally hit me soon after a workout.In conclusion, I think that this product is quite good.  It helps with keep energy level up during the entire workout and makes you feel good afterward.  The only negative point I could find was that the texture was a little strange, but that's a small point.  I definitely think the product will be a good fit in my workout schedule.",,101,

soupee_uk,5/7/2013,46,f,Edina,MN,3,Race to Review Energy Blends,mixed feelings,"We were lucky enough to be given the chance to try this for free as a bzzagent. What are PowerBar® Performance Energy Blends? Well they are promoted as a refueling option for anyone who exercises. The company says they taste great because they are made with real fruit with no artificial flavors and they contain only a handful of ingredients. Also it may be important for you to know they are gluten free. Like all the fruit pouches out on the market they come in easy, no mess packaging, and they're easy to consume and reseal. But lets face it, the market currently offers a whole plethora of choices where fruit in pouches is concerned. So how are these different? well the company says they are formulated with Powerbars C2max formula. C2max is reported to fuel muscles via a 2:1 glucose to fructose blend found to deliver 20-50% more energy to muscles than glucose alone, and improve endurance performance by 8%.Now since no one in my family has the means to scientifically prove or refute this claim I can only comment on our experience. My son is on a swim team so I thought his training sessions would provide a great opportunity to try this product. In fairness I should report that he "" refueled"" after a long school day as we raced to get from school to swim practice so he did not use the product to refuel after exercise but more to fuel up before exercise.Sure it was easy to carry with me to give him in the car and it was mess free and convenient for him to consume in the car. He also said it tasted nice and he would eat it again. But I cant honestly say noted any great power to it and so in that respect for us it is on a par with all its competitors. I did get some money off coupons so I will share them and also get a couple more to try but that's it. We are not for or against this product, I suspect the emphasis on special sport qualities will mean it is more expensive so most likely for us we wouldnt go out of our way to buy it. If you""re in a exercise situation where nutrition can make or break a result then I say go and try them for yourself and see if you notice any impact. For us they were simply a great little snack, no science needed!",,94,

The package was easy to open, however I found the texture hard to stomach.  It reminded me of baby food and it was an unappetizing brown color.  The flavor was pretty good.  30 minutes later I went for a 4 mile run, and unfortunately the PowerBar Performance Energy Blend did not sit well in my stomach.  I felt nauseous and kept experiencing banana blueberry burps (sorry TMI).  By the end of my run my stomach hurt.  I don't usually have stomach issues during my runs, so I think it was caused by the Energy Blend.

Snowandmo,5/6/2013,53,f,Havre De Grace,MD,5,Race to Review Energy Blends,Adventures with PowerBar Energy Blend,"One of my latest campaigns is PowerBar Performance Energy Blend.  I tried it for the first time on Sunday, May 5th when I took my long run.   I started with the Strawberry Apple Mango while I was preparing for my run.  The directions said have one 30-60 minutes prior to the activity and 1 in the middle, so I had the Apple Mango while getting everything together for the run.  Now I'm not really a fan of energy drinks like Red Bull and others that always tasted like liquid sugar to me, but this was really good!  It has the consistency of really fine apple sauce and was quite fruity!  I could definitely feel the difference as I was heading on the trail.  It was the first time out this year, and normally. I would start to run down pretty quickly, but it didn't happen.  Halfway through the run, I had the second pouch which happened to be the Banana Blueberry!  Again, I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor, not sugary sweet at all, and very fruity. quite enjoyable!  I finished the run feeling good, and ready to continue on with my day!  There was no ""crash"" feeling later, and I managed to attend a cookout with friends!  All in all a very successful test.  I am definitely interested in trying this product again!  I think it will help me in my quest to complete a half marathon! ",,,

eliabeth87,5/6/2013,26,f,Forrest,IL,4,Race to Review Energy Blends,PowerBar Energy Blends Empower!!!,"I am in love with PowerBar® Performance Energy Blends! I am very physically active and I love playing competitive sports. During the week I train a lot on my own (running, cross-fit workouts) and I also participate in several competitive athletic leagues - swimming, beach volleyball, and tract and field relays. During competitions I am always looking to find a natural, healthy energy supplement just so I don't feel too fatigued...and I think I have finally found the perfect solution - PowerBar Performance Energy Blends!!!First of all I love the taste and texture of the blends. I liked the Apple Strawberry flavor best simply because I am not a huge fan of bananas. The texture was more like eating apple sauce as opposed to trying to down a thick syrup as some other energy blends offer. The powerbar blends had a very natural taste to them as well being that they didn't taste like chemicals or artificial ingredients - they simply tasted like blended fruit! Secondly, I really liked the convenience of the PowerBar Blends. The size and amount is perfect for me and I love the easy to carry, resealable design. I usually like to take little amounts of the blend as I go so I can space the glucose fuel throughout the more strenuous part of my workout or sporting activity. and just as a side note, I love how it is gluten free as well as a certain health condition warrants me to try and limit my gluten intake.Thirdly, I definitely felt a boost of energy and stamina throughout my workouts. I am not diabetic but I occasionally have issues with slightly lower blood sugar especially when the weather is really hot. Usually this makes me feel a little fatigued (my nutriitionist suggested a high carb intake and glucose supplements prior to sporting events)- however when I used to PowerBar Performance blends I felt energized throughout the entire activity. Usually I have to take little breaks or I can just feel my body wearing down but I felt great!!! I'm not saying that these blends make you feel supercharged or give you extreme strength and endurance but I could feel and see a slight increase in my energy level after using these blends. I guess the 2:1 glucose to fructose C2Max really gives muscles more fuel! I will definitely be keeping PowerBar Blends in my gym bag just to have on hand whenever and wherever I need that extra boost and fuel for my body. ",,,

I am going to try it in a protein shake to see if I like it. The best thing about the Power Bar blends is that they are resealable, don't need to be refrigerated, and is just enough to give you energy without weighing you down.

This way, I knew I’d be able to pay attention to the clock, to see how long it took to kick in.The flavours PowerBar provided for me were Apple Mango Strawberry and Banana Blueberry. I put both on my treadmill’s shelf and set to running.I run 3-6 days per week – usually only 3 or 4 miles per run. I didn’t have a set distance in my head. I decided just to run until I started to feel a little fatigued, then use the Energy Blends.Once I got about 3 and 1/2 miles in, I started to get to the point where I was hitting “the wall”. I hadn’t actually intended on a run that day, and truth be told, had not properly fueled up before the run. I had barely eaten that morning.I grabbed one of the PowerBar packets at random and easily opened and downed it within a few seconds. Then I kept running, while watching the timer.The one I grabbed happened to be the Banana-Blueberry. The banana flavour kind of reminded me of baby food(or applesauce), but not in a bad way.I think I probably would like the other flavour better, but haven’t tried it yet.About 2-3 minutes after using the Energy Blend(all the while, still running), I started to feel slightly better. I had slowed down slightly, but at this point was starting to feel more even again.5-6 minutes after using the packet, I was at a point where I could increase my speed again.10-12 minutes after using the packet, I felt MUCH better, and got my second wind. I was able to speed back up and run easily.  I stopped at 5 and 1/2 miles, since I had things to do – but I felt like I could have kept running with no problem.calories burned: 823VERDICT: There was definitely a measurable recovery when using this during my run. I’m not sure I would use this for an every day run. However, if I was running a race, I would absolutely be sure to take a couple of these with me.If I knew I was really going to be pushing myself during a workout, I would consider using it for that, as well.I am extremely happy to see a Sports Performance product that doesn’t contain caffeine. I am caffeine sensitive, and only allow a certain amount per day(which is in my morning coffee). That reason alone makes it a great product, in my opinion.The low calorie count, lack of artificial flavours and colours, fact that it is made with real fruit are all big pluses, as well.Thanks BzzAgent and PowerBar for sending me a great product to review!",,,24
milesawy,5/3/2013,45,f,Pensacola,FL,4,Race to Review Energy Blends,Powerbar Performance is deserving of and encore,"I really enjoyed the taste and combination of flavors used for this energy boost. The product is smooth, reminded me of baby food, but once I got past that, it was all good! When used prior to physical activity, it did provide a bit more energy, but the 18 and 19gms of sugar seemed a bit much for a 3.17 oz pkg. Both flavor combinations are sweet but the blueberry banana was, by far, the sweeter of the two. The small package size makes it ideal for portability, but I recommend refrigeration before use. The taste was much better when it was chilled, less of a reminder of the baby food idea! *smile*I like the top of this package but not sure what the point is. Was able to loop a clip through it to carry it with me, so maybe thats the reason for the crazy top!",,441,

krllama,5/2/2013,37,f,Oakland,CA,3,Race to Review Energy Blends,Like 'em but don't love 'em ,"Tried out the PowerBar Performance Energy Blends for the first time this morning -- banana-blueberry flavor.  I always find it difficult to know what to eat before a morning run. A full meal makes me feel sick, but I need something or I crash halfway through. I thought this was the perfect chance to try one of these energy blends. First, the flavor / texture.  The blends come in foil packets, which look kind of like extra-large gels with a resealable top.  But what's inside tastes, looks, and has the texture of baby food puree. It definitely tastes much more like ""real food"" than any gel I've ever used, and I liked the blueberry-banana flavor just fine. I felt like I had good energy on my run, and I didn't get cramps feel weighed down. I like that the ingredients are pretty much just fruit and a little sugar (they give it a fancy name and call it a special blend, but it is just a kind of sugar), not a whole bunch of un-pronounce-able synthetic ingredients. However, I'm not sure I'll actually USE these blends regularly for two reasons.  First, they're way too big to carry on a workout. These are 3-4 times the size of an energy gel, with a bulky screw-off cap. Realistically, they'd be a pain to carry on a long run -- too big for the pocket in my running shorts/tights. Even for a bike ride, they would just take up too much of my limited pocket space, especially since at only 80 calories each, I'd need 2-3 for a long ride. Second, they're WAY too expensive. There is no way I'm going to regularly pay $3 a pop for what amounts to pureed fruit. The max I'm willing to pay for an energy bar or gel is about $1.50. ",,,

wendydugo,5/1/2013,37,f,Temperance,MI,2,Race to Review Energy Blends,Reminded me of baby food,I don't generally like energy supplements but gave this a try. It reminded me of baby food. The consistency was strange and I had a hard time ingesting it because of that.  My 9 year old son liked it and did not mind the texture at all. I wont buy it again,,,
potts0521,5/1/2013,40,f,Peoria,IL,3,Race to Review Energy Blends,3.5 stars but could be 5 with a little improvement,"My 14 year old is a competitive runner - faster and more serious than most adults. He ate the Banana Blueberry Powerbar Performance Energy Blend before a track meet this evening and was happy that I was offering him something that wasn't a ""bar"". Even though he knows he should eat something right before he runs to fuel his work out, it is often difficult for him to wrap his mind around chewing and eating something that feels heavy in his stomach afterwards. He liked the ""drinkable""-ness of the performance Energy blends event better than the chews put out by Powerbar. He felt the flavor was good however, he indicated it would be much better chilled and that the consistency was just a bit to thick. He would prefer it to be a bit thinner, like applesauce.  We gave it 3.5 stars for those two reasons. As I was driving home two of his teammates he got out the empty packet to show them as he had told them about it at practice. I dropped coupons off to both their moms! ",,139,11

mellanosstva,5/1/2013,28,f,Henderson,NV,5,Race to Review Energy Blends,Works Great and gives you a nice boost!,"is immediately after I got it in the mail. I had a few questions I had about this product, 1) Does It Taste Good? and 2) Does It work?For me taste is a big thing and I have to say, IT TASTE GOOD! I was surprised because most power shakes/mix/smoothies I have tried in the past don't taste that well even though they claim that it does. The Apple Mango Strawberry though has to taste the best in my opinion. So that answered one of the two questions I had before I tried this product. I drank the Energy Blend and after 30 or so minutes I was out the door to take my neighborhood run. I gotta say it gave a nice boost to my run. I felt more energized. That's the best way I can describe the feeling. I LOVED how it felt running. My run took a detour up the hill to the next gated community! My legs burn now but I like that it gave me that boost to push my exercise and allow me to challenge my body. So I can say that my second question was answered without a doubt, ""Does This Work?"" and my answer to that is ""YES!"" My brother in law was at home and he is a huge workout fanatic. When I got home he noticed I was sweating more than normal. He asked if I was okay. I told him about my long run and how I got to try PowerBar Performance Energy Blends from BzzAgent. I told him that all you have to do is take it a 30 minutes before your workout and it gives you a great boost to power through your workout. I gave him the other PowerBar Energy Blend to try since I told him I'm gonna go pick up more later when I go to the store. He came back to me an hour later and told me that he thought ""this stuff is awesome"". I gave him a coupon and a few extra to give to his workout buddies next time he heads to the gym. I can truly say my brother in law and I will be buying this in the near future! Thank BzzAgent an Powerbar ar for allowing me to try this",,,

I enjoyed both of them. I drank them before I ran and then would put the cap back on and enjoy the rest of it after my run. One day, I took one to the gym with me. It was a perfect pickme up to get me through my workout ( I was struggling that day).I think everyone would enjoy these real fruit power packs!! ",,,

adrees,5/1/2013,43,f,Defiance,OH,5,Race to Review Energy Blends,"Good taste, great energy","I tried both of these in one day. A disclaimer here, I am not by any means a highly trained athlete. I do my three to six sessions of cardio a week and can run a 5k on short notice but I'm not a marathoner and probably never will be.That said, I like the PowerBar Performance Energy Blends. I tried the Apple Mango Strawberry about half an hour before a three mile run with warm up and cool down. Three miles is an average day's run for me but I noticed I didn't have as much let down at about 1.75 miles as I normally do having used the PowerBar product.The second one, Banana Blueberry, I had after my Celtic dancing class. This is aerobic but not as sustained as the run is. We dance and take short breaks between. As far as flavor goes, the Apple Mango Strawberrry was better but I didn't even have the usual mild cramping from working on dancing that I normally do with the Blueberry Banana. Keep in mind that Celtic dance requires many kicks and jumps and if you're not on the balls of your feet at all times, you're probably making a mistake!Generally, the taste is good, the packaging convenient, and the nutrition was helpful to me both before and after a workout. I think I'll be using these before runs more often and keeping the Blueberry Banana blend on hand for any muscle cramps.I got both of these free from BzzAgent and I'm grateful for them for the chance to try this new to me product!",,173,6

I would recommend this product for athletes who like to refuel after workouts. The only reason for 4 stars is the wasteful plastic cap - i mean really? who's going to drink half of ths tiny drink and put the cap back on? Bad for the landfill - poor design.
